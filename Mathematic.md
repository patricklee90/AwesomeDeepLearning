[LCM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_common_multiple), by Wikipedia
- smallest common multiple of two integers a and b, usually denoted by LCM(a, b), is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both a and b.
- that can be used before fractions can be added, subtracted or compared. 
- The LCM of more than two integers is also well-defined: it is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of them.

## Greatest Common Divisor(DCM)
- which are not all zero, is the largest positive integer that divides each of the integers.
- The greatest common divisor is also known as the greatest common factor (gcf),[3] highest common factor (hcf),[4] greatest common measure (gcm),[5] or highest common divisor.[6]
